Pathfinding Visualizer is a simple visualizer for pathfinding algorithms. The project was created in Unity using C# for a school project. The project displays pathfinding algorithms working is way around walls to an end point placed by the user. Currently, only the A* and Greedy best-first algorithms are implemented in the project.
